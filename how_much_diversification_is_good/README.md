Approach:
- Select 30 random stocks from the Nifty100 list on the Jan 1st of 2015
- Exit on 30th Dec of 2015
- Repeat the same for 2016 though 2022
- Compute the average return across all these years and track the cumulative ROI as we keep on adding more stocks to the portfolio

Limitations:
- Study assumes a fixed date to enter and exit
- Simulation is done from the Nifty 100 list only
- Only 20 simulations were tested
