Approach:
- Select a random date between 2015 (1st Jan) and 2022 (31st Dec)
- Select 5 random shares from Nifty100 list
- Invest Rs 100,000 into each of them
- Exit the portfolio after one year
- Make 200 such portfolio simulations
- Compute the average annual roi across all the simulations

Limitations:
- Study assumes a random date to enter
- Simulation is done from the Nifty 100 list only
- Only 200 simulations were tested
